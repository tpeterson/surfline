Smaller waves on tap now with easing SSW swell and some smaller westerly swell in the water. Most areas see knee to waist+ zone surf with occasional sets to chest high. Standout spots run slightly larger, and there are a few fun, crossed-up peaks at the better combo beachbreaks. The tide is on the rise, eventually reaching a 4.36' HIGH just before 10am.<br><br><strong>Short-Term Forecast for the South Bay:</strong> Our SSW and westerly swell mix eases further through the day. Expect shape to really slow down as the tide tops out around mid morning. A moderate onshore sea breeze develops for the afternoon.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> County health officials advise against ocean water contact for up to 72 hours following a period of significant rainfall due to elevated bacteria levels - especially near drain pipes, harbors and river mouths."
